WORKING OF SQOOP
Sqoop is a tool designed to transfer data between Hadoop and relational database servers.
 It is used to import data from relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle to Hadoop HDFS, and export from Hadoop file system to relational databases.
 It is provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
Sqoop Import
The import tool imports individual tables from RDBMS to HDFS. 
Each row in a table is treated as a record in HDFS.
 All records are stored as text data in text files or as binary data in Avro and Sequence files.

Sqoop Export
The export tool exports a set of files from HDFS back to an RDBMS. 
The files given as input to Sqoop contain records, which are called as rows in table.
Those are read and parsed into a set of records and delimited with user-specified delimiter.
